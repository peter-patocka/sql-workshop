# Database normalization

## What is database normalization?

Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to **reduce data redundancy** and **improve data integrity**.

## Why normalize database?

* reduce duplicity & redundancy
* divides a larges table into smaller
* good database structure is just a must in long-term projects

## There are 5 normal forms:

### 1NF First Normal Form

ðŸ”¥ Remove duplicated values ðŸ”¥

Before: 

| ID | Phone |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 7272826385, 9064738238 |

After:

| ID | Phone |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 7272826385 |
| 2 | 9064738238 |

### 2NF Second Normal Form

ðŸ”¥ Non-key attributes depend only on the primary key ðŸ”¥

### 3NF Third Normal Form

ðŸ”¥ Remove transitive partial dependency ðŸ”¥

### 4NF Fourth normal form

ðŸ”¥ No multi-valued dependency (create UNIQUE keys) ðŸ”¥

## 5NF Fifth normal form

ðŸ”¥ Split database into as many tables as possible in order to avoid redundancy ðŸ”¥

## Common Rules

To sum up, use this rules to design tables:

* every table should have primary key
* primary key should be [UNIQUE](https://vertabelo.com/blog/database-constraints-types/#uniquekey)
* think about [NULL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-null-values.htm) or [NOT NULL](https://vertabelo.com/blog/database-constraints-types/#notnull) columns 
(with or without [DEFAULT](https://vertabelo.com/blog/database-constraints-types/#default) values) when creating new columns
* create relations with [FOREIGN keys](https://vertabelo.com/blog/database-constraints-types/#foreignkey)
* when designing table think about duplicity. Ask yourself: `is possible to create two rows with duplicated data?` If answer is yes âž¡ split table into more tables.
* if needed, create [CHECK](https://vertabelo.com/blog/database-constraints-types/#check) to validate data
* to speed up table queries (SELECT + JOINs), create [INDEXes](https://www.sqlshack.com/sql-index-overview-and-strategy/)
